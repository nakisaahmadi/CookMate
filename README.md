# CookMate

A Flutter project aimed at helping college students learn to cook by allowing them to find new recipes using ingredients they may have or find at the store. It provides a one stop location for shopping and meal planning.

## Getting Started

1. Download the TestFlight app from the appstore. If the app is not found, the link below will prompt you to download it.

2. Follow the following link: https://testflight.apple.com/join/iy1L5AEG

3. Tap View in TestFlight or Start Testing. This should prompt you to install the application and then you'll be able to access our app! We hope you enjoy it!

NOTE: An internet connection is REQUIRED for use

Additional Info: We fixed a lot of the bugs in the calendar page that we noted in the project details but we also discovered a few additional. In addition the video is currently being uploaded to youtube and we will post an additional comment with the link when it is finished before you start testing. 

1. There is a bug on the login screen, if you swipe right it will take you to an infinite loading screen. This is solved by 
force restarting the app. We were able to fix this bug but not in the build that we got approved above.

2. Some recipes don't have an image provided by the api so don't be alarmed if you see a default image.

3. There are some cases where the ingredients are doubled in the autocompleted list, this starting happening intermittently in 
the latest build and we weren't able to figure it out.

4. Upon first installing the app and navigating to the search page the search bar takes a little bit to load this is because it is also is loading the ingredient list.

5. When adding a duplicate recipe to the shopping list the quantity is not doubled.

6. The popup that is supposed to display when a barcode is not found is not working in this build :((((

7. There is a bug if the api does not provide us with an image URL, it will show error messages on the page.
